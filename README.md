Hey there! I'm Jatin Gagwani, a Data Analyst with a passion for digital marketing (still learning the ropes!). While I may not have mastered everything yet, I bring a healthy dose of enthusiasm and a relentless thirst for knowledge to the table.

### What I Do:
- **Certified Data Analyst (Google, you say?!):** I may not have memorized the entire Google Data Analytics certification manual, but I can definitely wrangle some data and extract valuable insights. (Okay, maybe I memorized most of it. But not all of it. Probably.)
- **Meta Certified Digital Marketer (Take that, Social Media!):** Don't let the fancy certificate fool you, I'm still figuring out the best way to navigate the ever-changing world of digital marketing. But hey, I'm a fast learner! (Just ask my overflowing bookshelf of marketing books...)

### Experience:
- **1+ Year Data Analyst Experience (That's Right, One Plus!):** I may not have a decade of experience under my belt, but I've definitely learned a lot from my time working in the fashion industry and tackling freelance projects. (Plus, who needs a decade when you have pure, unadulterated enthusiasm?)
- **Workflow Wizard (Not Really, But I Did Automate Some Stuff):** Let's just say I made some data workflows a little less manual (and a lot less prone to human error... hopefully!).

### Beyond the Numbers:
- **Tech Enthusiast (But Definitely Not a Coding Master):** I dabble in Python, Jupyter notebooks, App Script, and SQL. While I may not be a coding rockstar (yet!), I'm always up for a challenge.
- **Digital Marketing Student (Forever!):** From Meta and SEO to Wix and Wordpress, I'm constantly trying to expand my digital marketing knowledge. (Maybe someday I'll actually understand all the acronyms!)

### Connect With Me!
Have a data challenge or a burning digital marketing question? Don't hesitate to ping me here! I'm always happy to connect and learn from others. (Plus, who knows, maybe you can teach me a thing or two!)

**P.S.** Check out my website ([JatinGagwani.com](https://JatinGagwani.github.io/)) for more details and see if there are any blogs or services I offer that might be helpful!
